    Transport zone profile list parameters
DVSConfig:
    The DVS Configuration
LBServerSslProfileBinding:
    Server SSL profile binding. LBServerSslProfileBinding is deprecated as NSX-T
    Load Balancer is deprecated.
PolicyDHGroup:
    Diffie-Hellman groups represent algorithm used to derive shared keys between
    IPSec VPN initiator and responder over an unsecured network. GROUP2 uses
    1024-bit Modular Exponentiation (MODP) group. GROUP5 uses 1536-bit MODP
    group. GROUP14 uses 2048-bit MODP group. GROUP15 uses 3072-bit MODP group.
    GROUP16 uses 4096-bit MODP group.
ResourceAllocation:
    Specify limit, shares and reservation for all kinds of traffic. Values for
    limit and reservation are expressed in percentage. And for shares, the value
    is expressed as a number between 1-100. The overall reservation among all
    traffic types should not exceed 75%. Otherwise, the API request will be
    rejected.

    Source from which the address binding is obtained
EdgeHighAvailabilityProfile:
    Profile for BFD HA cluster setting
ChildCommunicationMap:
    Child wrapper object for CommunicationMap, used in hierarchical API This
    type is deprecated. Use the type ChildSecurityPolicy instead.
CookiePersistenceModeType:
    If the persistence cookie is found in the incoming request, value of the
    cookie is used to identify the server that this request should be sent to.
    If the cookie is not found, then the server selection algorithm is used to
    select a new server to handle that request. Three different modes of cookie
    persistence are supported: insert, prefix and rewrite. In cookie insert
    mode, a cookie is inserted by load balancer in the HTTP response going from
    server to client. In cookie prefix and rewrite modes, server controls the
    cookie and load balancer only manipulates the value of the cookie. In prefix
    mode, server's cookie value is prepended with the server IP and port and
    then sent to the client. In rewrite mode, entire server's cookie value is
    replaced with the server IP and port in the response before sending it to
    the client.
MetadataProxy:
    (missing)
NamedTeamingPolicy:
    Uplink Teaming Policy with a name that can be referenced by logical switches
LbRuleMatchType:
    LbRuleMatchType is used to determine how a specified string value is used to
    match a specified LbRuleCondition field. STARTS_WITH: If the LbRuleCondition
    field starts with specified string, the condition matches. The fields with
    this match type are specified as strings, not regular expressions.
    ENDS_WITH: If the LbRuleCondition field ends with specified string, the
    condition matches. The fields with this match type are specified as strings,
    not regular expressions. EQUALS: If the LbRuleCondition field is same as the
    specified string, the condition matches. The fields with this match type are
    specified as strings, not regular expressions. CONTAINS: If the
    LbRuleCondition field contains the specified string, the condition matches.
    The fields with this match type are specified as strings, not regular
    expressions. REGEX: If the LbRuleCondition field matches specified regular
    expression, the condition matches. The regular expressions in load balancer
    rules use the features common to both Java regular expressions and Perl
    Compatible Regular Expressions (PCREs) with some restrictions. Reference
    http://www.pcre.org for PCRE and the NSX-T Administrator's Guide for the
    restrictions. If named capturing groups are used in the regular expression,
    when a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that match named
    capturing groups are stored (captured) in variables with specific names
    which can be used in the fields of LbRuleAction which support variables.
    Named capturing group are defined in the format (?&lt;name&gt;subpattern),
    such as (?&lt;year&gt;\d{4}). For example, in the regular expression:
    "/news/(?&lt;year&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;month&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;article&gt;.*)", for
    subject string "/news/2017/06/xyz.html", the substring "2017" is captured in
    variable year, "06" is captured in variable month, and "xyz.html" is
    captured in variable article. These variables can be used in LbRuleAction
    fields which support variables in form of $name, such as $year, $month,
    $article. Please note, when regular expressions are used in JSON(JavaScript
    Object Notation) string, every backslash character (\) needs to be escaped
    by one additional backslash character.
LBServerAuthType:
    Server authentication could be AUTO_APPLY, REQUIRED or IGNORE, it is used to
    specify if the server certificate presented to the load balancer during
    handshake should be actually validated or not. Validation is automatic by
    default when server_auth_ca_certificate_paths are configured and IGNORED
    when they are not configured. If validation is REQUIRED, then to be
    accepted, server certificate must be signed by one of the trusted CAs whose
    self signed certificates are specified in the same server-side SSL profile
    binding.
LBRuleCondition:
    Match conditions are used to match application traffic passing through load
    balancers. Multiple match conditions can be specified in one load balancer
    rule, each match condition defines a criterion for application traffic. If
    inverse field is set to true, the match result of the condition is inverted.
    If more than one match condition is specified, match strategy determines if
    all conditions should match or any one condition should match for the load
    balancer rule to be considered a match. Currently only HTTP messages are
    supported by load balancer rules. Each load balancer rule is used at a
    specific phase of load balancer processing. Currently three phases are
    supported, HTTP_REQUEST_REWRITE, HTTP_FORWARDING and HTTP_RESPONSE_REWRITE.
    Each phase supports certain types of match conditions, supported match
    conditions in HTTP_REQUEST_REWRITE phase are: LBHttpRequestMethodCondition

    HTTP requests.
MonitorType:
    Load balancers monitor the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is
    not black holed. There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive.
    Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST
    from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or
    the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer
    itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers

TransportZoneProfileListResult:
    Transport zone profile queries result
LBHttpRequestUriCondition:
    This condition is used to match URIs(Uniform Resource Identifier) of HTTP
    request messages. The URI field can be specified as a regular expression. If
    an HTTP request message is requesting an URI which matches specified regular
    expression, it matches the condition. The syntax of whole URI looks like
    this: scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]
    This condition matches only the path part of entire URI. When match_type
    field is specified as REGEX, the uri field is used as a regular expression
    to match URI path of HTTP requests. For example, to match any URI that has
    "/image/" or "/images/", uri field can be specified as: "/image[s]?/". Named
    capturing groups can be used in the uri field to capture substrings of
    matched URIs and store them in variables for use in LBRuleAction. For
    example, specify uri field as:
    "/news/(?&lt;year&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;month&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;article&gt;.*)" If the
    URI path is /articles/news/2017/06/xyz.html, then substring "2017" is
    captured in variable year, "06" is captured in variable month, and
    "xyz.html" is captured in variable article. These variables can then be used
    in an LBRuleAction field which supports variables, such as uri field of
    LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction. For example, set the uri field of
    LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction as: "/articles/news/$year-$month-$article"
    Then the URI path /articles/news/2017/06/xyz.html is rewritten to:
    "/articles/news/2017-06-xyz.html"

    local and remote subnet needs to be defined. Tunnel is established for each
    pair of local and remote subnet defined in protect rules. - A Route Based
    L3Vpn is more flexible, more powerful and recommended over policy based. IP
    Tunnel subnet is created and all traffic routed through tunnel subnet
    (commonly known as VTI) is sent over tunnel. Routes can be learned through

    section of HTTP request and response messages. They define the operating
    parameters of an HTTP transaction. For example, Cookie, Authorization, User-
    Agent, etc. One condition can be used to match one header field, to match
    multiple header fields, multiple conditions must be specified. The
    match_type field defines how header_value field is used to match HTTP
    responses. The header_name field does not support match types.
LbHttpRequestUriArgumentsCondition:
    This condition is used to match URI arguments aka query string of Http
    request messages, for example, in URI http://exaple.com?foo=1&bar=2, the
    "foo=1&bar=2" is the query string containing URI arguments. In an URI
    scheme, query string is indicated by the first question mark ("?") character
    and terminated by a number sign ("#") character or by the end of the URI.
    The uri_arguments field can be specified as a regular expression(Set
    match_type to REGEX). For example, "foo=(?&lt;x&gt;\d+)". It matches HTTP
    requests whose URI arguments containing "foo", the value of foo contains
    only digits. And the value of foo is captured as $x which can be used in
    LbRuleAction fields which support variables.

    transaction. For example, Cookie, Authorization, User-Agent, etc. One
    condition can be used to match one header field, to match multiple header
    fields, multiple conditions must be specified. The match_type field defines
    how header_value field is used to match HTTP requests. The header_name field
    does not support match types.

LBRuleAction:
    Load balancer rule actions are used to manipulate application traffic.
    Currently load balancer rules can be used at three load balancer processing
    phases. Each phase has its own supported type of actions. Supported actions
    in HTTP_REQUST_REWRITE phase are:   LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction
    LBHttpRequestHeaderRewriteAction   LBHttpRequestHeaderDeleteAction
    LBVariableAssignmentAction Supported actions in HTTP_FORWARDING phase are:
    LBHttpRejectAction   LBHttpRedirectAction   LBSelectPoolAction
    LBVariablePersistenceOnAction   LBConnectionDropAction Supported action in
    HTTP_RESPONSE_REWRITE phase is:   LBHttpResponseHeaderRewriteAction
    LBHttpResponseHeaderDeleteAction   LBVariablePersistenceLearnAction
    Supported action in HTTP_ACCESS phase is:   LBJwtAuthAction
    LBConnectionDropAction   LBVariableAssignmentAction Supported action in
    TRANSPORT phase is:   LBSslModeSelectionAction   LBSelectPoolAction  If the
    match type of an LBRuleCondition field is specified as REGEX and named
    capturing groups are used in the specified regular expression. The groups
    can be used as variables in LBRuleAction fields. For example, define a rule
    with LBHttpRequestUriCondition as match condition and
    LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction as action. Set match_type field of
    LBHttpRequestUriCondition to REGEX, and set uri field to
    "/news/(?&lt;year&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;month&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;article&gt;.*)". Set uri
    field of LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction to:   "/news/$year-$month/$article"
    In uri field of LBHttpRequestUriCondition, the (?&lt;year&gt;\d+),
    (?&lt;month&gt;\d+) and (?&lt;article&gt;.*) are named capturing groups,
    they define variables named $year, $month and $article respectively. The
    defined variables are used in LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction. For a matched
    HTTP request with URI "/news/2017/06/xyz.html", the substring "2017" is
    captured in variable $year, "06" is captured in variable $month, and
    "xyz.html" is captured in variable $article. The
    LBHttpRequestUriRewriteAction will rewrite the URI to:
    "/news/2017-06/xyz.html" A set of built-in variables can be used in
    LBRuleAction as well. The name of built-in variables start with underscore,
    the name of user defined variables is not allowed to start with underscore.
    Following are some of the built-in variables:   $_scheme: Reference the
    scheme part of matched HTTP messages, could be "http" or "https".   $_host:
    Host of matched HTTP messages, for example "www.example.com".
    $_server_port: Port part of URI, it is also the port of the server which
    accepted a request. Default port is 80 for http and 443 for https.   $_uri:
    The URI path, for example "/products/sample.html".   $_request_uri: Full
    original request URI with arguments, for example,
    "/products/sample.html?a=b&c=d".   $_args: URI arguments, for instance
    "a=b&c=d"   $_is_args: "?" if a request has URI arguments, or an empty

    Severity is calculated from usage percentage: GREEN means the current usage
    percentage is less than 60%. ORANGE means the current usage percentage is
    less than 80% and larger than or equal to 60%. RED means the current usage
    percentage is larger than or equal to 80%.
LbHttpRequestUriCondition:
    This condition is used to match URIs(Uniform Resource Identifier) of HTTP
    request messages. The URI field can be specified as a regular expression. If
    an HTTP request message is requesting an URI which matches specified regular
    expression, it matches the condition. The syntax of whole URI looks like
    this: scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]
    This condition matches only the path part of entire URI. When match_type
    field is specified as REGEX, the uri field is used as a regular expression
    to match URI path of HTTP requests. For example, to match any URI that has
    "/image/" or "/images/", uri field can be specified as: "/image[s]?/". Named
    capturing groups can be used in the uri field to capture substrings of
    matched URIs and store them in variables for use in LbRuleAction. For
    example, specify uri field as:
    "/news/(?&lt;year&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;month&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;article&gt;.*)" If the
    URI path is /articles/news/2017/06/xyz.html, then substring "2017" is
    captured in variable year, "06" is captured in variable month, and
    "xyz.html" is captured in variable article. These variables can then be used
    in an LbRuleAction field which supports variables, such as uri field of
    LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction. For example, set the uri field of
    LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction as: "/articles/news/$year-$month-$article"
    Then the URI path /articles/news/2017/06/xyz.html is rewritten to:
    "/articles/news/2017-06-xyz.html"
StaticIpMacListSpec:
    IP and MAC assignment specification for Static IP List.

    specified new values at HTTP_RESPONSE_REWRITE phase. One action can be used
    to rewrite one header field. To rewrite multiple header fields, multiple
    actions must be defined. Captured variables and built-in variables can be
    used in the header_value field, header_name field does not support
    variables.

LBIpHeaderCondition:
    This condition is used to match IP header fields of HTTP messages. Either
    source_address or group_id should be specified.
LBHttpMonitorProfile:
    Active healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled for a server
    pool by binding a health monitor to the Group through the LBRule object.
    This represents active health monitoring over HTTP. Active healthchecks are
    initiated periodically, at a configurable interval, to each member of the
    Group. Only if a healthcheck fails consecutively for a specified number of
    times (fall_count) to a member will the member status be marked DOWN. Once a
    member is DOWN, a specified number of consecutive successful healthchecks
    (rise_count) will bring the member back to UP state. After a healthcheck is
    initiated, if it does not complete within a certain period, then also the
    healthcheck is considered to be unsuccessful. Completing a healthcheck
    within timeout means establishing a connection (TCP or SSL), if applicable,
    sending the request and receiving the response, all within the configured
    timeout. LBHttpMonitorProfile is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is
    deprecated.
LbPersistenceCookieTime:
    (missing)
LBHttpRejectAction:
    This action is used to reject HTTP request messages. The specified
    reply_status value is used as the status code for the corresponding HTTP
    response message which is sent back to client (Normally a browser)
    indicating the reason it was rejected. Reference official HTTP status code
    list for your specific HTTP version to set the reply_status properly.
    LBHttpRejectAction does not support variables.

LbRuleCondition:
    Match conditions are used to match application traffic passing through load
    balancers. Multiple match conditions can be specified in one load balancer
    rule, each match condition defines a criterion for application traffic. If
    inverse field is set to true, the match result of the condition is inverted.
    If more than one match condition is specified, match strategy determines if
    all conditions should match or any one condition should match for the load
    balancer rule to be considered a match. Currently only HTTP messages are
    supported by load balancer rules. Each load balancer rule is used at a
    specific phase of load balancer processing. Currently three phases are
    supported, HTTP_REQUEST_REWRITE, HTTP_FORWARDING and HTTP_RESPONSE_REWRITE.

    original destination address before NAT is done. For REFLEXIVE, to egress
    traffic, the firewall will be applied to the translated source address after
    NAT is done; To ingress traffic, the firewall will be applied to the
    original destination address before NAT is done. MATCH_INTERNAL_ADDRESS
    indicates the firewall will be applied to internal address of a NAT rule.
    For SNAT, the internal address is the original source address before NAT is
    done. For DNAT, the internal address is the translated destination address
    after NAT is done. For REFLEXIVE, to egress traffic, the firewall will be
    applied to the original source address before NAT is done; To ingress
    traffic, the firewall will be applied to the translated destination address
    after NAT is done. BYPASS indicates the firewall stage will be skipped.

    communication entry specified in the anchor_path belongs to another
    communication map an error will be thrown This type is deprecated. Use the
    type RuleInsertParameters instead.
LbHttpRedirectAction:
    This action is used to redirect HTTP request messages to a new URL. The
    reply_status value specified in this action is used as the status code of
    HTTP response message which is sent back to client (Normally a browser). The
    HTTP status code for redirection is 3xx, for example, 301, 302, 303, 307,
    etc. The redirect_url is the new URL that the HTTP request message is
    redirected to. Normally browser will send another HTTP request to the new
    URL after receiving a redirection response message. Captured variables and
    built-in variables can be used in redirect_url field. For example, to
    redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS requests for a virtual server. We create
    an LbRule without any conditions, add an LbHttpRedirectAction to the rule.
    Set the redirect_url field of the LbHttpRedirectAction to:
    https://$_host$_request_uri And set redirect_status to "302", which means
    found. This rule will redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS server port on the
    same host.
LbNodeUsageSummary:
    The load balancer node usage summary for all nodes. Only EdgeNode is
    supported. The summary calculation is based on all edge nodes configured in
    edge clusters.
MonitorQueryType:
    MonitorQueryType is used to query load balancer monitors. LbActiveMonitor
    represents active load balancer monitors. While LbActiveMonitor is specified
    to query load balancer monitors, it returns all active monitors, including

LBRule:
    Binding of a LBPool and Group to a LBVirtualServer used to route application
    traffic passing through load balancers. LBRule uses match conditions to
    match application traffic passing through a LBVirtualServer using HTTP or
    HTTPS. Can bind multiple LBVirtualServers to a Group. Each LBRule consists
    of two optional match conditions, each match contidion defines a criterion
    for application traffic.  If no match conditions are specified, then the
    LBRule will always match and it is used typically to define default rules.
    If more than one match condition is specified, then matching strategy
    determines if all conditions should match or any one condition should match
    for the LBRule to be considered a match.  A match indicates that the
    LBVirtualServer should route the request to the Group (parent of LBRule).
    LBRule is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LBGenericPersistenceProfile:
    Some applications maintain state and require all relevant connections to be
    sent to the same server as the application state is not synchronized among
    servers. Persistence is enabled on a LBVirtualServer by binding a
    persistence profile to it. LBGenericPersistenceProfile cannot be attached to
    virtual server directly, it can be specified in LB rule actions. In HTTP
    forwarding phase, the profile can be specified in
    LBVariablePersistenceOnAction. In HTTP response rewriting phase, the profile
    can be specified in LBVariablePersistenceLearnAction.
    LBGenericPersistenceProfile is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is
    deprecated.
TransportNodeUpdateParameters:
    Transport node update parameters are mainly used for migrating ESX VMkernel
    (vmk) interfaces and VM NICs into or out-of logical switches. The
    'esx_mgmt_if_migration_dest' and 'if_id' must be used as a pair to migrate
    vmk interfaces; they can not be used to migrate VM NICs. NSX manager will
    auto-create logical ports and vif ids for the vmk interfaces when they are
    used to migrate vmks into logical switches. The 'vnic' and
    'vnic_migration_dest' must also be used as a pair; they can be used to
    migrate both vmk interfaces and VM NICs. When they are used to migrate
    interfaces into logical switches, logical ports and vif ids must be created
    in advance because 'vnic_migration_dest' must contain existing vif ids.
    These two paires can not be specified together.
LbSslCipherAndProtocolListResult:
    (missing)
LBTcpHeaderCondition:
    This condition is used to match TCP header fields of HTTP messages.

LbHttpRequestHeaderCondition:
    This condition is used to match HTTP request messages by HTTP header fields.
    HTTP header fields are components of the header section of HTTP request and
    response messages. They define the operating parameters of an HTTP
    transaction. For example, Cookie, Authorization, User-Agent, etc. One
    condition can be used to match one header field, to match multiple header
    fields, multiple conditions must be specified. The match_type field defines
    how header_value field is used to match HTTP requests. The header_name field
    does not support match types.
LbNodeUsageType:
    The node type for load balancer node usage.
PerNodeUsedCacheStatistics:
    Query statistics counters of used cache from node
LbRuleAction:
    Load balancer rule actions are used to manipulate application traffic.
    Currently load balancer rules can be used at three load balancer processing
    phases. Each phase has its own supported type of actions. Supported actions
    in HTTP_REQUST_REWRITE phase are:   LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction
    LbHttpRequestHeaderRewriteAction   LbHttpRequestHeaderDeleteAction
    LbVariableAssignmentAction Supported actions in HTTP_FORWARDING phase are:
    LbHttpRejectAction   LbHttpRedirectAction   LbSelectPoolAction

    Supported action in HTTP_ACCESS phase is:   LbJwtAuthAction
    LbConnectionDropAction   LbVariableAssignmentAction Supported action in
    TRANSPORT phase is:   LbSslModeSelectionAction   LbSelectPoolAction  If the
    match type of an LbRuleCondition field is specified as REGEX and named
    capturing groups are used in the specified regular expression. The groups
    can be used as variables in LbRuleAction fields. For example, define a rule
    with LbHttpRequestUriCondition as match condition and
    LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction as action. Set match_type field of
    LbHttpRequestUriCondition to REGEX, and set uri field to
    "/news/(?&lt;year&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;month&gt;\d+)/(?&lt;article&gt;.*)". Set uri
    field of LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction to:   "/news/$year-$month/$article"
    In uri field of LbHttpRequestUriCondition, the (?&lt;year&gt;\d+),
    (?&lt;month&gt;\d+) and (?&lt;article&gt;.*) are named capturing groups,
    they define variables named $year, $month and $article respectively. The
    defined variables are used in LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction. For a matched
    HTTP request with URI "/news/2017/06/xyz.html", the substring "2017" is
    captured in variable $year, "06" is captured in variable $month, and
    "xyz.html" is captured in variable $article. The
    LbHttpRequestUriRewriteAction will rewrite the URI to:
    "/news/2017-06/xyz.html" A set of built-in variables can be used in
    LbRuleAction as well. The name of built-in variables start with underscore,
    the name of user defined variables is not allowed to start with underscore.
    Following are some of the built-in variables:   $_scheme: Reference the
    scheme part of matched HTTP messages, could be "http" or "https".   $_host:
    Host of matched HTTP messages, for example "www.example.com".
    $_server_port: Port part of URI, it is also the port of the server which
    accepted a request. Default port is 80 for http and 443 for https.   $_uri:
    The URI path, for example "/products/sample.html".   $_request_uri: Full
    original request URI with arguments, for example,
    "/products/sample.html?a=b&c=d".   $_args: URI arguments, for instance
    "a=b&c=d"   $_is_args: "?" if a request has URI arguments, or an empty
    string otherwise. For the full list of built-in variables, please reference
    the NSX-T Administrator's Guide.
AttachmentType:
    Type of attachment for logical port.
LBJwtAuthAction:
    This action is used to control access to backend server resources using JSON
    Web Token(JWT) authentication. The JWT authentication is done before any
    HTTP manipulation if the HTTP request matches the given condition in LBRule.
    Any verification failed, the HTTP process will be terminated, and HTTP
    response with 401 status code and WWW-Authentication header will be returned
    to client.

** Deprecated Property Definitions

LbVirtualServer.server_ssl_profile_binding:
    The setting is used when load balancer acts as an SSL client and
    establishing a connection to the backend server. The property is deprecated
    as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbVirtualServer.default_pool_member_port:
    This is a deprecated property, please use 'default_pool_member_ports'
    instead. If default_pool_member_port is configured and
    default_pool_member_ports are not specified, both default_pool_member_port
    and default_pool_member_ports in response payload would return the same port
    value. If both are specified, default_pool_member_ports setting would take
    effect with higher priority.
LbVirtualServer.port:
    This is a deprecated property, please use 'ports' instead. Port setting
    could be single port for both L7 mode and L4 mode. For L4 mode, a single
    port range is also supported. The port setting could be a single port or
    port range such as "80", "1234-1236". If port is configured and ports are
    not specified, both port and ports in response payload would return the same
    port value. If both port and ports are configured, ports setting would take
    effect with higher priority.
LbVirtualServer.max_concurrent_connections:
    To ensure one virtual server does not over consume resources, affecting
    other applications hosted on the same LBS, connections to a virtual server
    can be capped. If it is not specified, it means that connections are
    unlimited. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbVirtualServer.max_new_connection_rate:
    To ensure one virtual server does not over consume resources, connections to
    a member can be rate limited. If it is not specified, it means that
    connection rate is unlimited. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
LbVirtualServer.sorry_pool_id:
    When load balancer can not select a backend server to serve the request in
    default pool or pool in rules, the request would be served by sorry server
    pool. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbVirtualServer.client_ssl_profile_binding:
    The setting is used when load balancer acts as an SSL server and terminating
    the client SSL connection The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer
    is deprecated.
LbVirtualServer.rule_ids:
    Load balancer rules allow customization of load balancing behavior using
    match/action rules. Currently, load balancer rules are supported for only
    layer 7 virtual servers with LbHttpProfile. The property is deprecated as
    NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbHttpProfile.ntlm:
    NTLM is an authentication protocol that can be used over HTTP. If the flag
    is set to true, LB will use NTLM challenge/response methodology. This
    property is deprecated. Please use the property server_keep_alive in order
    to keep the backend server connection alive for the client connection. When
    create a new profile, if both ntlm and server_keep_alive are set as
    different values, ERROR will be reported. When update an existing profile,
    if either ntlm or server_keep_alive value is changed, both of them are
    updated with the changed value.
LBPool.passive_monitor_path:
    Passive healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled by attaching
    a passive health monitor to a server pool. Each time a client connection to
    a pool member fails, its failed count is incremented. For pools bound to L7
    virtual servers, a connection is considered to be failed and failed count is
    incremented if any TCP connection errors (e.g. TCP RST or failure to send
    data) or SSL handshake failures occur. For pools bound to L4 virtual
    servers, if no response is received to a TCP SYN sent to the pool member or
    if a TCP RST is received in response to a TCP SYN, then the pool member is
    considered to have failed and the failed count is incremented. The property
    is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LBPool.active_monitor_paths:
    In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new
    connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their
    health, completely independent of any data traffic. Active healthchecks are
    disabled by default and can be enabled for a server pool by binding a health
    monitor to the pool. If multiple active monitors are configured, the pool
    member status is UP only when the health check status for all the monitors
    are UP. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LBPool.tcp_multiplexing_enabled:
    TCP multiplexing allows the same TCP connection between load balancer and
    the backend server to be used for sending multiple client requests from
    different client TCP connections. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
LBPool.tcp_multiplexing_number:
    The maximum number of TCP connections per pool that are idly kept alive for
    sending future client requests. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
DropdownFilterWidgetConfiguration.weight:
    Specify relavite weight in WidgetItem for placement in a view. Please see
    WidgetItem for details.
DropdownFilterWidgetConfiguration.shared:
    Please use the property 'shared' of View instead of this. The widgets of a
    shared view are visible to other users.
DropdownFilterWidgetConfiguration.filter:
    Id of filter widget for subscription, if any. Id should be a valid id of an
    existing filter widget. Filter widget should be from the same view.
    Datasource URLs should have placeholder values equal to filter alias to
    accept the filter value on filter change. This field is deprecated instead
    use 'filters' property.
LbVirtualServerWithRule.rules:
    It is used to add rules, update rules and bind rules to the virtual server.
    To add new rules, make sure that the rules have no identifier specified, the
    new rules are automatically generated and associated to the virtual server.
    If the virtual server need to consume some existed rules without change,
    those rules should not be specified in the list, otherwise, the rules are
    updated. For update_with_rules action, it supports rules delete and update.
    To delete old rules, the rules should not be configured in new action, the
    UUID of deleted rules should be removed from rule_ids. To update rules, the
    rules should be specified with new change and configured with identifier. If
    there are some rules which are not modified, those rule should not be
    specified in the rules list, the UUID list of rules should be specified in
    rule_ids of LbVirtualServer. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
RealizedNSService.runtime_status:
    Possible values could be UP, DOWN, UNKNOWN, DEGRADED This list is not
    exhaustive.
Segment.address_bindings:
    Static address binding used for the Segment. This field is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. Please use address_bindings in
    SegmentPort to configure static bindings.

    default pool or pool in rules, the request would be served by sorry server
    pool. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LBVirtualServer.rules:
    Load balancer rules allow customization of load balancing behavior using
    match/action rules. Currently, load balancer rules are supported for only
    layer 7 virtual servers with LBHttpProfile. The property is deprecated as
    NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LBVirtualServer.max_new_connection_rate:
    To ensure one virtual server does not over consume resources, connections to
    a member can be rate limited. If it is not specified, it means that
    connection rate is unlimited. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
LBVirtualServer.client_ssl_profile_binding:

LbPool.passive_monitor_id:
    Passive healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled by attaching
    a passive health monitor to a server pool. Each time a client connection to
    a pool member fails, its failed count is incremented. For pools bound to L7
    virtual servers, a connection is considered to be failed and failed count is
    incremented if any TCP connection errors (e.g. TCP RST or failure to send
    data) or SSL handshake failures occur. For pools bound to L4 virtual
    servers, if no response is received to a TCP SYN sent to the pool member or
    if a TCP RST is received in response to a TCP SYN, then the pool member is
    considered to have failed and the failed count is incremented. The property
    is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbPool.snat_translation:
    Depending on the topology, Source NAT (SNAT) may be required to ensure
    traffic from the server destined to the client is received by the load
    balancer. SNAT can be enabled per pool. If SNAT is not enabled for a pool,
    then load balancer uses the client IP and port (spoofing) while establishing
    connections to the servers. This is referred to as no-SNAT or TRANSPARENT
    mode. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbPool.tcp_multiplexing_number:
    The maximum number of TCP connections per pool that are idly kept alive for
    sending future client requests. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.
LbPool.active_monitor_ids:
    In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new
    connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their
    health, completely independent of any data traffic. Active healthchecks are
    disabled by default and can be enabled for a server pool by binding a health
    monitor to the pool. If multiple active monitors are configured, the pool
    member status is UP only when the health check status for all the monitors
    are UP. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.
LbPool.tcp_multiplexing_enabled:
    TCP multiplexing allows the same TCP connection between load balancer and
    the backend server to be used for sending multiple client requests from
    different client TCP connections. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load
    Balancer is deprecated.

    fields will be picked up by this re-allication API. The othere fields in the
    payload will be ignored.  If the edge-cluster-id in the payload DhcpProfile
    is different from the current edge-cluster-id of the profile, the
    referencing DHCP server(s) will be re-allocated to the new edge cluster. If
    the edge-cluster-id is not changed, the referencing DHCP server(s) will be

    cluster member indexes are provided, they should exist in the given edge
    cluster. If the indexes are not specified in the DhcpProfile, edge members
    will be auto-allocated from the given edge cluster.  Please note that re-
    allocating edge-cluster will cause lose of all exisitng DHCP lease

    Services &gt; Advanced Load Balancing section of the API guide.
ListTransportZones (GET /transport-zones):
    Returns information about configured transport zones. NSX requires at least
    one transport zone. NSX uses transport zones to provide connectivity based
    on the topology of the underlying network, trust zones, or organizational
    separations. For example, you might have hypervisors that use one network
    for management traffic and a different network for VM traffic. This
    architecture would require two transport zones. The combination of transport
    zones plus transport connectors enables NSX to form tunnels between
    hypervisors. Transport zones define which interfaces on the hypervisors can
    communicate with which other interfaces on other hypervisors to establish
    overlay tunnels or provide connectivity to a VLAN. A logical switch can be
    in one (and only one) transport zone. This means that all of a switch's
    interfaces must be in the same transport zone. However, each hypervisor
    virtual switch (OVS or VDS) has multiple interfaces (connectors), and each
    connector can be attached to a different logical switch. For example, on a
    single hypervisor with two connectors, connector A can be attached to
    logical switch 1 in transport zone A, while connector B is attached to
    logical switch 2 in transport zone B. In this way, a single hypervisor can
    participate in multiple transport zones. The API for creating a transport
    zone requires that a single host switch be specified for each transport
    zone, and multiple transport zones can share the same host switch. This api
    is now deprecated. Please use new api - /infra/sites/&lt;site-id&gt

UpdateDhcpProfile (PUT /dhcp/server-profiles/<profile-id>):
    If both the edge_cluster_member_indexes in the DhcpProfile are changed in a
    same PUT API, e.g. change from [a,b] to [x,y], the current DHCP server
    leases will be lost, which could cause the network crash due to ip
    conflicts. Hence the suggestion is to change only one member index in one
    single update, e.g. from [a, b] to [a,y].  Please note, the edge_cluster_id
    in DhcpProfile can NOT be changed by this PUT operation because all existing
    DHCP leases will lost. If losing leases is not a problem, a dedicated re-
    allocation API is suggested to modify the edge-cluster-id, i.e. "POST
    /api/v1/dhcp/dhcp-profiles/&lt;profileiid&gt;?action=reallocate".
    Meanwhile, if the edge_cluster_member_indexes was specified currently but
    now is changed to none (not specified) via a PUT operation, the edge nodes
    will not be auto-selected from edge cluster. Instead, the previously-
    allocated edge nodes will continue to be used by the DHCP server. This is
    because changing both edge nodes of a DHCP server will lose all existing
    leases. In case re-allocation is required and leases lost is not a problem
    (or can be recovered), please invoke the reallocate API mentioned above with
    new DhcpProfile to accomplish the intent.
ListNatRules (GET /logical-routers/<logical-router-id>/nat/rules):
